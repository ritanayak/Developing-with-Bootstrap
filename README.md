  Review and Reflect
 -------------------
                                                                           
 1-What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
 The main challenge was mapping existing custom CSS to the correct Bootstrap utility classes and adjusting layouts to fit Bootstrap’s grid and component structure while maintaining the original design.
 2. How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
 Bootstrap simplified styling by reducing the need for custom CSS. Utility classes made spacing, alignment, and responsiveness faster to implement, and built-in components ensured consistent design.
 3. In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
 Custom CSS is preferable for highly unique designs, performance-critical projects, or when advanced customization and animations are required.
